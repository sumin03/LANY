## The reason I tried to change this website.

### 📍https://www.thisislany.com/ 
> This is original LANY website 

**There has lots of reason but THE MAIN REASON IS..<br> 
I am a huge fan of LANY so I wanted to make their website with _the vibe_ they have. <br>
so I tried to re-design and code to show How much I care about my client characteristic.**



 ## I tried to change like this. 

1. Deleting the page which is not necessary (I mean the page, We can see when we click the website)

2. Trying to use vibrant color + pastel color to show their unique mood that people like 

3. For people their character is very soft and unique so I tried to use geometric shape and put some pics of them to emphasize that 

4. Even though this is their public website, doesn't have their information so I designed their information part like a music magazine

5. For making it user-friendly, I made 'BACK TO TOP' button for users that they do not have to scroll all the way back to the top 



## What I change in code

I tried to make design totally different way. 
The original website was pretty tricky to use it when you first time use (at least for me) 
so I deleted the first page thaat I could see, and for Making it user-friendly, I added 'BACK TO TOP' button on the website, which page is longer than browser height. 
For the first time When I tried this I only used Jquery, but I decieded to re-make it with pure vanila javascript. 
Here is the difference but You can check it on my history too. 




#### Changed css code 

I didn't know using **':root'** element before so wrote every element values by myself, even though I kept writing same values. 
So After studying **':root'** element so I changed it like this

Can you see the differences?

## What I like the most on my website 

1. I really like the color, atmosphere, vibe on the website. I really worked hard to find the perfect color which suit their character.

2. I made **'back to top button**. As one of a website user, I sometimes found out the annoyed part when website do not offer 'back to top' button. 
So I put it in for users. 


3. In Album part, When you open the page you cannot see anything but **When you click the album that I put** Then you can see that **album tracks**. I also put music player icons, So users can directly go to that website and able to listent to it right away. 

4. In Tour part, When you scroll the page the website height automatically change, show more items to users. Plus, When users click on the button on the top then They can only see the item they want to see.
