## The reason I tried to change this website.

### 📍https://www.thisislany.com/ 
> This is original twosome place website 

**There has lots of reason but THE MAIN REASON IS..<br> 
I am a huge fan of LANY so I wanted to make their website with _the vibe_ they have. <br>
so I tried to re-design and code to show How much I care about my client characteristic.**



 ## I tried to change like this. 

1. Deleting the page which is not necessary (I mean the page, We can see when we click the website)

2. Trying to use vibrant color + pastel color to show their unique mood that people like 

3. For people their character is very soft and unique so I tried to use geometric shape and put some pics of them to emphasize that 

4. Even though this is their public website, doesn't have their information so I designed their information part like a music magazine

5. For making it user-friendly, I made 'BACK TO TOP' button for users that they do not have to scroll all the way back to the top
